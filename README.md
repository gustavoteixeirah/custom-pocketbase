# Pocketbase Application with SMTP and S3 Integration

This Go-based application uses the `pocketbase` library to build an API server with integration to SMTP and S3 services.

## Dependencies

* The `github.com/spf13/cast` package used for type-safe casting of values.
* The `log` standard library package for logging errors and fatal events.
* The `os` standard library package for using environment variables.
* The `github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase` and `github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core` packages for creating and managing the Pocketbase application.

## Main Functionality

### Step 1: Create New Application
The application is created using `pocketbase.New()`, storing the instance in `app`.

### Step 2: Load Settings
This application is designed to load SMTP and S3 settings from environment variables before serving.

The loading operation is carried out in `app.OnBeforeServe().Add()`, which is a method where pre-server-start operations can be added.

#### SMTP Settings Load
Parsed and cast environment variables are assigned to the application's SMTP settings like this:
The SMTP settings are validated and if there's any error during the validation, it will fatal log the event and return the error.

#### S3 Settings Load
The S3 settings are handled essentially identically to the SMTP's:

```go
app.Settings().S3.Enabled = cast.ToBool(os.Getenv("S3_ENABLED"))
app.Settings().S3.Endpoint = os.Getenv("S3_ENDPOINT")
app.Settings().S3.Bucket = os.Getenv("S3_BUCKET")
app.Settings().S3.AccessKey = os.Getenv("S3_ACCESS_KEY")
app.Settings().S3.Secret = os.Getenv("S3_SECRET")
app.Settings().S3.Region = os.Getenv("S3_REGION")
app.Settings().S3.ForcePathStyle = cast.ToBool(os.Getenv("S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE"))
```

The S3 settings are also validated and any error during validation will cause the application to log the failure and return the error.

### Step 3: Start Application
Finally, the application is started with app.Start(). If there's an error when starting, it will be logged as a fatal event.


### Note
This current script does not provide any mechanism to protect the loaded settings from being modified after initialization. The comment // prevent settings change... seems to infer that such protection was planned but has not been implemented.

Please remember to replace the triple backtick block with the indentation for code blocks in your final version as necessary.
